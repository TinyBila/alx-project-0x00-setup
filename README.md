# alx-project-0x00-setup
This project introduces the basics of setting up and structuring a Next.js application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint. we will delve into Next.js, a powerful React framework that enhances the development experience by providing built-in features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing. We will explore how to navigate the Next.js documentation effectively, understand what it means to scaffold a project using Next.js, and examine the components of a Next.js project, including its streamlined file-based routing system.

## The goal was to:

- Scaffold a new Next.js project with create-next-app.

- Explore the Pages Router for simple routing.

- Organize project structure with components/ and interfaces/.

- Build reusable components (Card, Pill, Button).

- Leverage TypeScript interfaces & props to make components dynamic.
